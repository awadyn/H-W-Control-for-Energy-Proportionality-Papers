Relevant Literature on Power Management for High-Performance Systems
____________________________________________________________________

Energy Proportionality:
-----------------------
Literature related to maximizing the utilization of server-like systems.
- Relevance: expoliting processor frequency scaling to optimize for energy
- Going further: exploiting frequency scaling in tandem with network interrupt coalescing 
		 to optimize for energy in network-facing servers

Power Management:
-----------------
Literature on hardware and system control for power management.
